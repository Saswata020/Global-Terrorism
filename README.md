# Global-Terrorism
OBJECTIVE 
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a database on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017 containing over 1,81,692observations.

Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the security of the international community. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), we can analyze the damage from terrorist attacks and different groups that are active. The various factors influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three dimensions. Subsequently, using Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, Basemap for analysis and processing, and we can analyze the data. Based on this grading standard, we can see the most used weapon. We can analyze different terror groups across the globe and their operation area. We can see the shift in terrorism by analyzing the data from 1970 to 2016 and increase in radicalization in the different regions and increasing the deadly suicidal attack etc.  We can see the type of attack and the target type.
Finally, we analyze terrorist attacks in India, considering the terrorist attack targets and key areas of terrorist attacks. We can analyze the terrorism-affected states and active terror groups in India. We can also see the most used weapon by the terror groups of India.
The results of this research can help individuals and the government to enable a better understanding of terrorism, improve awareness to prevent terrorism and enhance emergency management and rescue, and provide a solid and reliable basis and reference for joint counterterrorism in various countries and regions.

SUMMARY

Some key insights from the data above include
1. Global terrorism expanded rapidly post (2001), and the center of terrorism has shifted from the West to the Middle East and in South Asia, it has sharply increased;
2. The number of killings, and wounded has increased significantly after 2010. Suicidal attacks also have been increased which shows us the increase in radicalization.
3. Most of the time explosive has been used as weapons and attacks type was bombing/explosion.
4. Paying ransom to terrorists could turn into a vicious cycle — causing more kidnapping and the expansion of terrorist organizations. However, more detailed data is needed for us to understand the mechanism behind ransom and kidnapping.
5. The top four countries facing terrorism are Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India and the terror groups are  Taliban, ISIL, FARC, Maoists, etc.
6. Private citizens were not always the target of terrorists worldwide — in some regions, military targets and infrastructure were also vulnerable;
7. In India major terrorist activities have occurred in the States of Jammu and Kashmir, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Manipur, and Jharkhand.
8. For Jammu and Kashmir we can see firemen are used more than explosives.
